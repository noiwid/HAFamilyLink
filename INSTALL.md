## Step 1: Install the Family Link Auth Add-on 🔧

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnoiwid%2FHAFamilyLink)

The add-on handles Google authentication using Playwright browser automation.

### 1.1 Add the Repository 📁

1. Open Home Assistant  
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Add-ons** > **Add-on Store**  
3. Click the **...** menu (top right) > **Repositories**

   ```
5. Click **Add** > **Close**

### 1.2 Install the Add-on ⏬

1. In the Add-on Store, search for **"Google Family Link Auth"**  
2. Click on the add-on  
3. Click **Install**  
   - This may take 5-10 minutes (downloads Chromium browser) ⏱️  
   - Wait for "Installation completed" message

### 1.3 Configure the Add-on ⚙️

1. After installation, **do NOT start it yet**  
2. Click on the **Configuration** tab  
3. Review the default settings:  
   ```yaml
   port: 8099
   log_level: info
   # Cookies are stored as /share/familylink/cookies.enc (encrypted)
   ```
4. Change settings if needed (usually defaults are fine)  
5. Click **Save** 💾

### 1.4 Start the Add-on ▶️

1. Go to the **Info** tab  
2. Enable **"Start on boot"** (recommended)  
3. Enable **"Watchdog"** (automatically restarts if it crashes) 🐶  
4. Click **Start**  
5. Wait for the add-on to start (check logs for "Application startup complete") 📜

### 1.5 Authenticate with Google 🔐

**Important: You MUST use a VNC client to complete authentication!**

**Step 1: Open the add-on web interface**  
- Click "Open Web UI" (or navigate to `http://[YOUR_HA_IP]:8099`)  
- You should see the Family Link Auth interface

**Step 2: Start Authentication**  
- Click "Démarrer l'authentification" (Start Authentication)  
- The Chromium browser launches inside the add-on container  
- You cannot see it directly - you need VNC! 🖥️

**Step 3: Connect via VNC**  
- Open your VNC client (TightVNC, RealVNC, VNC Viewer, etc.)  
- **Address**: `[YOUR_HA_IP]:5900` (or just `[YOUR_HA_IP]` and port `5900`)  
- **Password**: `familylink`  
- Click **Connect**

**Step 4: Complete Google Login in VNC**  
- Enter your Google account email > Click **Next**  
- Enter your password > Click **Next**  
- Complete 2FA if prompted (SMS code, authenticator app, push notification, etc.)  
- Grant permissions if asked  
- **Keep the VNC window open** until you see the Family Link dashboard 🧭

**Step 5: Verify Success**
- The web interface (port 8099) will show "Authentication successful" ✅
- The add-on extracts cookies and saves them to `/share/familylink/cookies.enc` (encrypted) 🍪
- You can now close the VNC connection

**Important Notes:** ⚠️  
- The VNC session timeout is 5 minutes (configurable in add-on settings)  
- If authentication fails, restart the add-on and try again 🔁  
- The VNC password is always `familylink` (cannot be changed)

### 1.6 Verify Authentication 🧪

Check the add-on logs (**Log** tab):  
```
INFO: Navigating to https://families.google.com/families
INFO: Successfully extracted 26 cookies
INFO: Cookies saved to /share/familylink/cookies.enc (encrypted)
```
If you see "Successfully extracted X cookies", authentication is complete! 🎉

## Troubleshooting 🐛

### Integration Not Found 🔎

**Problem:** Can't find "Google Family Link" when adding integration  

**Solution:**  
1. Verify files are in `config/custom_components/familylink/`  
2. Restart Home Assistant  
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) 🧼  
4. Check logs for errors during startup

### Cookies Not Loading 🍪

**Problem:** Setup fails with error "No cookies found" or "invalid_auth" in the UI

**Where you see it:**
- **During setup**: Error message appears in the configuration dialog
- **In logs**: "Failed to load cookies from add-on" or "No cookies found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify add-on is running and has been used to authenticate at least once
2. Check `/share/familylink/cookies.enc` and `.key` exist:
   ```bash
   ls -la /share/familylink/
   # You should see: cookies.enc and .key (both files required)
   ```
3. Verify file permissions allow Home Assistant to read them:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /share/familylink/cookies.enc
   chmod 644 /share/familylink/.key
   ```
4. Restart add-on
5. Re-authenticate via add-on Web UI (port 8099)
6. Try adding the integration again

### 401 Authentication Errors 🔐

**Problem:** Logs show "401 Unauthorized" errors  

**Solution:**  
1. Cookies may have expired ⏳  
2. Open add-on Web UI (`http://[YOUR_HA_IP]:8099`)  
3. Click "Démarrer l'authentification"  
4. Complete Google login again  
5. Wait for success message  
6. Reload integration in Home Assistant

### No Entities Created 🫥

**Problem:** Integration loads but no sensors/switches appear  

**Solution:**  
1. Check logs for API errors  
2. Verify you have at least one supervised child  
3. Check that child has an active device 📱  
4. Wait 5 minutes for first data update ⏱️  
5. Reload integration

### Switch Not Working 📴

**Problem:** Can't lock/unlock device from Home Assistant  

**Solution:**  
1. Verify device is online and connected  
2. Check Family Link app shows device  
3. Try locking from Family Link app first (to test)  
4. Check logs for "Device control failed" errors  
5. Reload integration

### Top Apps Always Unavailable 📉

**Problem:** Top app sensors never show data  

**Cause:** No usage data for current date  

**Solution:**  
1. Wait until child uses apps today  
2. Sensors auto-populate when data becomes available  
3. Check tomorrow after device has been used
